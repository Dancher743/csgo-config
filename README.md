# csgo-config
My config for CS:GO.

Install
---
The first way:
1. Open Steam userdata folder - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<user_id>\730\local\cfg`.
2. Remove an existing `config.cfg` from the folder.
3. Place my config in the folder and rename it to `config.cfg`.

The second way:
1. Place my config to `steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` folder.
2. Press the `~` key in the main menu, and that will open the console.
2. Type `exec <my_config_name>` command.
3. Press Enter to apply my config.

**NOTE: In the second way you should re-install a config every time when you open the game.**
